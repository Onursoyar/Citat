I have created this website with the sole purpose of encouraging and motivating people into doing their bests and not give up through quotes and attached videos. I was inspired by the Swedish langauge and decided to name the website "CITAT", which means quote in English.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about updated and new quotes.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to submit my own and new quotes, poems and motivational speeches..
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added quotes, videos and more.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to their website so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website.

    -  ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are darkblue, the color rgba(250, 154, 9, 0.74) without name and smokewhite.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Varela font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Varela is a clean font which is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Videos
        -   The large, background videos is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is also relevant,motivational and encouraging .
